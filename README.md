# Comparing suicide rates with Human Development Index and Happiness Index scores (1990-2019)

## Introduction

Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is even on the rise in many countries. Certain populations and groups are particularly affected. For example, in the United Kingdom, suicide is thea leading cause of death for men under 50, and in recent years, the rate for young women under 24 has seen the steepest increase since records began. 

Death by suicide is often associated with specific health and societal factors, including long-term unemployment, financial hardship, social marginalisation and exclusion, homelessness and, in some groups such as children and young people, bullying.


## Linking suicide and Human Development and Happiness scores

Given the prevalence of suicide as a leading cause of death in many countries, it is interesting to look into indicators that provide an insight on such key factors as health, wellbeing and living standards, as well as the perception of the members of a society of their own happiness.

The Gapminder Foundation provides access to a wwalth of historical data on all these factors, and allow us to compare figures and trends across the years at global level.

This dashboard therefore aims to represent interesting insights from the Gapminder data, to see if a relationship can be identified between suicide rates, the Human Development Index and Happiness Index scores.
